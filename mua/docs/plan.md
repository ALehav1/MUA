# Moody's Underwriting Assistant (MUA) - Project Plan

## Project Overview
MUA is an interactive frontend prototype designed to assist commercial casualty underwriters in their decision-making process. The tool provides a comprehensive view of submission data, risk analysis, and quote recommendations.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Frontend UI/UX Build with Mock Data
- Build complete UI/UX flows using mock data
- Focus on visual presentation and navigation
- Implement all core screens and components
- No backend integration required

### Phase 2: Future Integration (Out of Scope for Now)
- Potential mock API endpoints
- Dynamic data retrieval simulation

## Technology Stack
- Frontend Framework: React
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- State Management: React Context API
- Component Architecture: Functional Components with Hooks

# MUA Project Tracking

## Project Setup - [2024-04-13]

### Initial Setup Decisions
1. **Framework Selection**: React chosen for its component-based architecture and strong ecosystem
2. **Styling Solution**: Tailwind CSS selected for rapid development and consistent design
3. **Build Tool**: Vite chosen for fast development experience
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript implemented for better code quality and maintainability

### Directory Structure
- Standard React project structure with additional organization for components, screens, and context
- Separate documentation directory for project documentation
- Dedicated test directory for all testing files

### Development Guidelines Established
1. Mobile-first responsive design approach
2. Component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
3. Comprehensive documentation requirements
4. Regular testing and validation process

## Mock Data Structure - [2024-04-13]

### Data Model Decisions
1. JSON-based mock data structure defined
2. TypeScript interfaces created for type safety
3. Sample data structure established for:
   - Submissions
   - Risk Analysis
   - Quote Recommendations
   - Interaction Logs

## Component Architecture - [2024-04-13]

### Core Components Identified
1. Dashboard Components
   - Submission Table
   - Filter/Sort Controls
   - Navigation Elements

2. Dossier Screen Components
   - Tab Navigation
   - Risk Analysis Display
   - Quote Recommendation Interface
   - Document Viewer

3. "Ask MUA" Feature Components
   - Chat Interface
   - Question Suggestions
   - Response Display

### State Management Approach
- React Context API selected for global state management
- Custom hooks planned for reusable logic
- Local state for component-specific data

## Testing Strategy - [2024-04-13]

### Testing Framework
- Jest and React Testing Library selected
- Component testing strategy defined
- Mock data generators planned

### Documentation Approach
- Markdown for project documentation
- JSDoc for code documentation
- Storybook planned for component documentation

## Next Steps

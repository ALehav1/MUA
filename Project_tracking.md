## Key Decisions

### 2024-04-14
1. **Project Structure**
   - Adopted component-based architecture
   - Implemented clear separation of concerns
   - Set up development tools for monitoring

2. **Technology Choices**
   - Selected React with TypeScript for type safety
   - Chose Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Implemented React Context for state management

3. **Development Approach**
   - Mobile-first responsive design
   - Component-driven development
   - Mock data first approach

## Issues and Resolutions

### Current Issues

### Issues Encountered and Solutions

1. **MCP Server TypeScript Errors**
   - Issue: TypeScript errors in MCPServer class related to EventEmitter and type declarations
   - Solution: Added proper type declarations and fixed the MCPServer class implementation
   - Files affected: mcp/server/mcpServer.ts, mcp/types/mcpTypes.ts
   - Commit: fix: resolve MCP server TypeScript errors

2. **MCP Client WebSocket Issues**
   - Issue: Failed to resolve import "ws" and WebSocket type errors
   - Solution: Added proper WebSocket type definitions and removed direct ws dependency
   - Files affected: mcp/client/mcpClient.ts
   - Commit: fix: resolve WebSocket type issues in MCP client

3. **Component Tracking Implementation**
   - Issue: Incorrect method names in useMCP hook causing runtime errors
   - Solution: Updated method names to match MCP client implementation
   - Files affected: src/hooks/useMCP.ts
   - Commit: fix: correct MCP tracking method names

4. **Application Routing**
   - Issue: MCPTest component showing instead of Dashboard
   - Solution: Updated App.tsx to use Dashboard component as home route
   - Files affected: src/App.tsx
   - Commit: fix: set Dashboard as home route

### Current Status
- MCP server running on port 8080
- Application running on port 3001
- Component tracking working correctly
- Dashboard displaying properly
- All routes functioning as expected

### Next Steps
1. Implement error boundaries for better error handling
2. Add more comprehensive MCP monitoring
3. Enhance dashboard features
4. Add unit tests for MCP functionality

## Development Guidelines

### Version Control
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Follow conventional commit format
- Document MCP-related changes
- Keep commit history clean and organized

### Code Quality

- Implement proper error handling
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Document complex logic

### MCP Integration
- Track all component additions
- Monitor performance metrics
- Log state changes
- Handle connection issues gracefully

### Testing
- Test MCP functionality
- Verify component tracking
- Check error handling
- Ensure proper cleanup
